<p><b>Dumbledore's Army</b> (also known as the D.A.) was a secret organisation initiated by <i>Harry Potter</i>, <i>Hermione Granger</i>, and <i>Ron Weasley</i> to teach their fellow Hogwarts colleagues proper <b>Defence Against the Dark Arts</b> in 1995. It was founded by Hermione, but taught and led by Harry.</p>

<p>It was restarted by <i>Neville Longbottom</i>, <i>Ginny Weasley</i>, and <i>Luna Lovegood</i> during the 1997-1998 school year after Hogwarts fell under the control of Lord Voldemort in order to oppose Death Eater professors Alecto and Amycus Carrow, <u>who spread propaganda against Muggles and Muggle-borns</u> and taught the Dark Arts.</p>

<p>Dumbledore's Army played a vital role during the <strong>Second Wizarding War</strong>, and members of the organisation fought in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, the Battle of the Astronomy Tower, and the Battle of Hogwarts.</p>
